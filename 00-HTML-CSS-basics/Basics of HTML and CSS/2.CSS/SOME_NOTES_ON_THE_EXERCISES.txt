This document is just to clarifiy the way I've gone about working on the tasks provided. Each of the folders contain almost the same layout (built following the model at the end of exercise 2.1), but with the proper modifications to meet the goals of each of the exercises in each point (2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5). In the case of 2.3, in order to solve the tasks related to CSS cascade, I've added comments explaining what I did and why, as well as the results of such actions within the CSS file. I also added a new text document to fully explain exercise 2.3) 7), since I figured it wasn't necessary to create a whole new CSS file, or append those classes to the HTML and CSS files I already had.
